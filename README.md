# Kymograph_tools
Add light stimulation signal to a kymograph, generate a rolling video

Tested on PNG files exported from ImageJ. 
Two PNG files as input: main image and light on/off signal image

Generated video is very large as no compression is performed. Using VLC, size can be significantly compressed. 
Install K-lite codec pack if Powerpoint fails to import the video.
