# Kymograph Tools
kym_with_laser_and_ruler.m: Adds a green light stimulation bar and ruler to a kymograph.
kymVideo.m: Generates a rolling kymograph video with a light stimulation bar and a seconds timer.

Tested on PNG files exported from ImageJ. 
Two PNG files as input: main image and light on/off signal image.

Generated video is very large as no compression is performed. Using VLC, size can be significantly compressed. 
Install K-lite codec pack if Powerpoint fails to import the video.
